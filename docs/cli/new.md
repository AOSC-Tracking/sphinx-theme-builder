# `stb new`

This command uses {pypi}`cookiecutter` under the hood, with a dedicated
template, to help set up a new project.

This is based on `cookiecutter` which means it is also possible for theme
authors to use tooling built for it -- like {pypi}`cruft`, to keep their theme
up to date with the underlying template, as the template evolves.

## Options

None.
